Basic Face Mask Detection using CNN and OpenCV

This project is a simple implementation of face mask detection using CNN to train the model and haarcascade to detect face.

Model.ipynb is the main model file.
It esports the model after every epoch.

The best epoch model :  model-17.model is given in the repository.

implmentation.py uses model-17.model and haarcascade to detect face with and without mask.
